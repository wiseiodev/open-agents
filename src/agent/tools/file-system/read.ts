  description: `Read a file from the filesystem.

USAGE:
- The path should be a FULL absolute path (e.g., /Users/username/project/file.ts), not just /file.ts
- If a root-like path (e.g., /README.md) does not exist on disk, it may be resolved relative to the workspace root
- Paths starting with /scratchpad/ are NOT read by this tool - scratchpad content is injected via system context
- By default reads up to 2000 lines starting from line 1
- Use offset and limit for long files (both are line-based, 1-indexed)
- Results include line numbers starting at 1 in "N: content" format

IMPORTANT:
- Always read a file at least once before editing it with the edit/write tools
- This tool can only read files, not directories - attempting to read a directory returns an error
- Access is restricted to files inside the current working directory; paths outside will be rejected
- You can call multiple reads in parallel to speculatively load several files

EXAMPLES:
- Read an entire file: filePath: "/Users/username/project/src/index.ts"
- Read a slice of a long file: filePath: "/Users/username/project/logs/app.log", offset: 500, limit: 200`,
