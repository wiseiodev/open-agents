  description: `Write content to a file on the filesystem.

WHEN TO USE:
- Creating a new file that does not yet exist
- Completely replacing the contents of an existing file after you've read it
- Generating code or configuration as part of an implementation task

WHEN NOT TO USE:
- Small or localized changes to an existing file (prefer editFileTool instead)
- Reading files (use readFileTool instead)
- Searching (use grepTool or globTool instead)

USAGE:
- The path must be an absolute path within the workspace
- This will OVERWRITE existing files entirely
- Parent directories are created automatically if they do not exist

IMPORTANT:
- ALWAYS read an existing file with readFileTool before overwriting it
- Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones unless a new file is explicitly needed
- NEVER proactively create documentation files (e.g., *.md) unless the user explicitly requests them
- Do not write files that contain secrets or credentials (API keys, passwords, .env, etc.)
- Access is restricted to paths inside the working directory; paths outside will be rejected

EXAMPLES:
- Create a new test file: filePath: "/Users/username/project/src/user.test.ts", content: "<full file contents>"
- Replace a script after reading it: filePath: "/Users/username/project/scripts/build.sh", content: "<entire updated script>"`,
  inputSchema: writeInputSchema,
  execute: async ({ filePath, content }, { experimental_context }) => {
    const context = experimental_context as AgentContext;
    const workingDirectory = context?.workingDirectory ?? process.cwd();

    try {
      const absolutePath = path.isAbsolute(filePath)
        ? filePath
        : path.resolve(workingDirectory, filePath);

      // Security check: ensure path is within working directory
      if (!isPathWithinDirectory(absolutePath, workingDirectory)) {
        return {
          success: false,
          error: `Access denied: path "${absolutePath}" is outside the working directory "${workingDirectory}"`,
        };
      }

      const dir = path.dirname(absolutePath);
      await fs.mkdir(dir, { recursive: true });
      await fs.writeFile(absolutePath, content, "utf-8");

  description: `Perform exact string replacement in a file.

WHEN TO USE:
- Making small, precise edits to an existing file you have already read
- Renaming a variable or identifier consistently within a single file
- Changing a specific block of code or configuration exactly as seen in the read output

WHEN NOT TO USE:
- Creating new files (use writeFileTool instead)
- Large structural rewrites where it's simpler to rewrite the entire file (use writeFileTool)
- Multi-file refactors (use grepTool + multiple edits, or taskTool for larger jobs)

USAGE:
- You must read the file first with readFileTool in this conversation
- Provide oldString as the EXACT text to replace, including whitespace and indentation
- By default, oldString must be UNIQUE in the file; otherwise the edit will fail
- Use replaceAll: true to change ALL occurrences of oldString in the file (e.g., for a rename)

IMPORTANT:
- Preserve exact indentation and spacing from the file's content as returned by readFileTool
- Never include line numbers or the "N: " line prefixes from the read output in oldString or newString
- If oldString appears multiple times and replaceAll is false, the tool will FAIL with an error and occurrence count
- Access is restricted to paths inside the working directory; paths outside will be rejected

EXAMPLES:
- Replace a single function call: filePath: "/Users/username/project/src/auth.ts", oldString: "login(user, password)", newString: "loginWithAudit(user, password)"
- Rename a variable throughout a file: filePath: "/Users/username/project/src/api.ts", oldString: "oldApiClient", newString: "newApiClient", replaceAll: true`,
  inputSchema: editInputSchema,
  execute: async ({ filePath, oldString, newString, replaceAll = false }, { experimental_context }) => {
